# ASG1
Wee Han's ASG1 for Interactive Development

For the index.html, i chose the following layout as i am able to display the goldfish products and equipment in different rows. I was able to produce a javascript script for the goldfish slider, that displays all the goldfish for stock in the slider.
as for the new additions, i included fish care items in this catergory for users to see whats new for sale at our website.
This page also includes the back to top button.

For the guide.html, i chose to include a fish care guide for this page as new users might need prior knowledge before they make an educated purchase at the goldfish website.
It encourages honesty, letting users know the many responsiblities in caring for fish. Alongside that, i made it easy to read, therefore the simple bullet point and header layout.
This page also includes the back to top button.

Finally, for the about.html, it is the about page of the company. Mentioning the about, mission and commitment to quality pledged by the company. 
This page also includes the back to top button.

In all 3 pages, i found the goldfish background with the message "premium goldfish at your fingertips" aesthetically pleasing, hence i chose to keep it.
The 3 buttons for guide,products and about us are located at the top right side of the screen for easy navigation.

The company logo is located at the top right of the pages.
